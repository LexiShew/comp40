Help:
    - We got help from Liana, Alan, and Adam, and we checked Piazza to see
        what other students were asking questions about.


Most Expensive Routine:
* (30%) Bit shifting while unpacking the different values:
    We have to shift the word left and right in order to isolate the value
    that we're trying to access. This several times for every instruction
    (e.g. for opcode, registers, val for loadval). There's not really a good
    way to avoid this routine since it's fairly inexpensive but needs to
    happen a lot. We tried only calling the getu function where needed (like
    we didn't call it at all in halt, but had to call it 3 times in arithmetic
    instructions), but this ended up being slower than having all getu calls
    at once before our switch statement. We discussed potentiall making
    hard-coded masks that can be AND-ed with the word to remove one shift
    operation, but this didn't seem like it would be any less expensive.
    
* Another thing that could be potentially improved (but didn't actually take
    that much time) could be unpacking the value for loadval directly into r[A]
    to potentially avoid putting another thing on the stack, though this would
    be a minor optimization that wouldn't impact overall runtime significantly.
