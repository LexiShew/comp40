This is a copy-paste of pnm.h, which is the header file for 
a program that deals with PPM representations. 
It defines a pnm_ppm struct, which stores the pixels of an image in
an A2 and assigns a method suite to use to alter the image.
It also has functions such as Pnm_ppmread, which takes in a PPM file
and a methods suite and returns a pnm_ppm pointer, and Pnm_ppmwrite,
which prints a pnm_ppm to a given file.
Pnm_ppmfree frees the pnm_ppm but not the methods suite
